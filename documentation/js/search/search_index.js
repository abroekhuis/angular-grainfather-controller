       \n\nAngular Grainfather Control\nThis project contains an example and the grainfather control library. \nThe example expects BrewFather batch files to be able to send a recipe to the controller.\nThis library was generated with Angular CLI version 9.1.3.\nIt can be used to control the GrainFather controller via BLE from within a browser.\nThe BLE specification is taken from https://github.com/kingpulsar/Grainfather-Bluetooth-Protocol.\nThe main module exposes an API to connect/reconnect/disconnect from the controller. \nIt also has a send method, which takes a Command from the commands files.\nAll commands are available as a class, with the Recipe command being the most complex one.\nRecipeDetails contain the minimal information that is needed to create a recipe. \nAll other values are assumed to have defaults for now.\nexport type MashStep = {\n  name: string;\n  stepTime: number;\n  stepTemperature: number;\n};\n\nexport type BoilStep = {\n  name: string;\n  time: number;\n  sent: boolean;\n};\n\nexport class RecipeDetails {\n  name: string;\n  mashWaterAmount: number;\n  spargeWaterAmount: number;\n  boilTime: number;\n  hopStandTime: number;\n  mashSteps: MashStep[];\n  boilSteps: BoilStep[];\n  delayMinutes: number;\n  delaySeconds: number;\n}Notifications are processed by the notifications handler. \nThis handler updates and broadcasts the state as well.\nIt uses the state to decrease the required interaction with the controller as much as possible.\nCurrently the following interactions are needed:\n\nStart session after sending recipe without delay\nAdd grain alarm\nSparge alarm\nStart boil timer\nStart hopstand timer\nFinish session\n\nIt also sends notifications with:\n\nCurrent step, see SessionState\nTime left for step, for delay, mash and boil\nIf a boil addition needs to be added, this will only be one event for each addition\n\nBuild\nRun ng build angular-grainfather-control to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nPublishing\nAfter building your library with ng build angular-grainfather-control, go to the dist folder cd dist/angular-grainfather-control and run npm publish.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test angular-grainfather-control to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nLicense\nCopyright 2020 Alexander Broekhuis\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
